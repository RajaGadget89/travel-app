## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file defines the current state of the project within the CursorRIPER Framework. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Always load this file after core.mdc but before other components
- Never modify state values without proper authorization via commands
- Validate state transitions against allowed paths
- Update this file when state changes occur
- Keep all state values consistent with each other

## STATE TRANSITION RULES

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> UNINITIATED
    
    UNINITIATED --> INITIALIZING: /start
    INITIALIZING --> DEVELOPMENT: START phase complete
    DEVELOPMENT --> MAINTENANCE: User request
    MAINTENANCE --> DEVELOPMENT: User request
    
    state INITIALIZING {
        [*] --> NOT_STARTED
        NOT_STARTED --> IN_PROGRESS: Begin START
        IN_PROGRESS --> COMPLETED: All steps finished
        COMPLETED --> ARCHIVED: Enter DEVELOPMENT
    }
    
    state "DEVELOPMENT/MAINTENANCE" as DM {
        [*] --> RESEARCH
        RESEARCH --> INNOVATE: /innovate
        INNOVATE --> PLAN: /plan
        PLAN --> EXECUTE: /execute
        EXECUTE --> REVIEW: /review
        REVIEW --> RESEARCH: /research
    }
```

### Phase Transitions
- UNINITIATED → INITIALIZING
  - Trigger: "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE"
  - Requirements: None
  
- INITIALIZING → DEVELOPMENT
  - Trigger: Automatic upon START phase completion
  - Requirements: START_PHASE_STATUS = "COMPLETED"
  
- DEVELOPMENT → MAINTENANCE
  - Trigger: Manual transition by user
  - Requirements: Explicit user request
  
- MAINTENANCE → DEVELOPMENT
  - Trigger: Manual transition by user
  - Requirements: Explicit user request

### Mode Transitions
- Any mode → RESEARCH
  - Trigger: "/research" or "ENTER RESEARCH MODE"
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
  
- Any mode → INNOVATE
  - Trigger: "/innovate" or "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
  
- Any mode → PLAN
  - Trigger: "/plan" or "ENTER PLAN MODE"
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
  
- Any mode → EXECUTE
  - Trigger: "/execute" or "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
  
- Any mode → REVIEW
  - Trigger: "/review" or "ENTER REVIEW MODE"
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]

### START Phase Status Transitions
- NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS
  - Trigger: "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE"
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE = "UNINITIATED"
  
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
  - Trigger: Completion of all START phase steps
  - Requirements: START_PHASE_STEP = 6
  
- COMPLETED → ARCHIVED
  - Trigger: Automatic after transition to DEVELOPMENT
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE = "DEVELOPMENT"

### Symbol Registry State Transitions
- NO → INITIALIZED
  - Trigger: Creation of @-symbol-registry.md file
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["INITIALIZING", "DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
  
- INITIALIZED → POPULATED
  - Trigger: Documentation of at least 10 project symbols
  - Requirements: SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED = "INITIALIZED"
  
- POPULATED → OPTIMIZED
  - Trigger: Addition of performance considerations to registry
  - Requirements: SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED = "POPULATED"

### Symbol Discovery Status Transitions
- NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS
  - Trigger: START phase step 6.1 completion or manual discovery start
  - Requirements: PROJECT_PHASE in ["INITIALIZING", "DEVELOPMENT", "MAINTENANCE"]
  
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
  - Trigger: Completion of @ symbol discovery process
  - Requirements: At least 10 symbols documented or manual completion

## STATE UPDATE PROCEDURES

### Update Project Phase
1. Validate transition is allowed
2. Create backup of current state
3. Update PROJECT_PHASE value
4. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
5. Perform any phase-specific initialization

### Update RIPER Mode
1. Validate transition is allowed
2. Update RIPER_CURRENT_MODE value
3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
4. Update activeContext.md to reflect mode change

### Update START Phase Status
1. Validate transition is allowed
2. Update START_PHASE_STATUS value
3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
4. If transitioning to COMPLETED, set INITIALIZATION_DATE

### Update START Phase Step
1. Validate step increment is logical
2. Update START_PHASE_STEP value
3. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
4. If reaching step 6, trigger completion process

### Update Symbol Registry State
1. Validate transition is allowed
2. Update SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED value
3. Update LAST_SYMBOL_UPDATE timestamp
4. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
5. If transitioning to POPULATED or OPTIMIZED, update activeContext.md

### Update Symbol Discovery Status
1. Validate transition is allowed
2. Update SYMBOL_DISCOVERY_STATUS value
3. Update LAST_SYMBOL_UPDATE timestamp
4. Update LAST_UPDATE timestamp
5. If transitioning to COMPLETED, update activeContext.md

## AUTOMATIC STATE DETECTION

When determining current project state:
1. Check for existence of memory bank files
2. If complete memory bank exists but STATE_PHASE is "UNINITIATED":
   - Set PROJECT_PHASE to "DEVELOPMENT"
   - Set START_PHASE_STATUS to "COMPLETED"
   - Set START_PHASE_STEP to 6
   - Set INITIALIZATION_DATE based on file timestamps
3. If partial memory bank exists:
   - Set PROJECT_PHASE to "INITIALIZING"
   - Set START_PHASE_STATUS to "IN_PROGRESS"
   - Determine START_PHASE_STEP based on existing files
4. Check for existence of @-symbol-registry.md:
   - If exists and contains >10 symbols, set SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED to "POPULATED"
   - If exists but contains <10 symbols, set SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED to "INITIALIZED"
   - If not exists, set SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED to "NO"
5. Determine SYMBOL_DISCOVERY_STATUS based on registry state and contents

## RE-INITIALIZATION PROTECTION

If "/start" or "BEGIN START PHASE" is detected when PROJECT_PHASE is not "UNINITIATED":
1. Warn user about re-initialization risks
2. Require explicit confirmation: "CONFIRM RE-INITIALIZATION"
3. If confirmed:
   - Create backup of current memory bank
   - Reset state to PROJECT_PHASE = "INITIALIZING"
   - Reset START_PHASE_STATUS to "IN_PROGRESS"
   - Reset START_PHASE_STEP to 1
   - Preserve SYMBOL_REGISTRY_CREATED and SYMBOL_DISCOVERY_STATUS if they exist
